# THREE.js powered website behind an emoji domain

## Why?

This project started as a joke about the existance of emoji domains. As I developed the idea futher I
wanted to dive deeper into THREE.js and WebGL renderers.

So I created this small website in some kind of vaporwave design and a very basic interactive particle
system that spits out the emojis of the domain.

## Installation & development

The website uses parcel to bundle itself so you should have node installed.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

The project will be ready on `localhost:1234`.

## Building for production

```
npm run build
```
